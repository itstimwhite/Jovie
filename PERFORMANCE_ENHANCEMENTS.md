# Artist Selector Performance Enhancements

## Overview

The artist selector has been significantly enhanced with multiple performance optimizations to provide a smooth, responsive user experience.

## Key Enhancements

### 1. Custom Search Hook (`useArtistSearch`)

- **Debouncing**: 300ms debounce to prevent excessive API calls
- **Caching**: 5-minute cache for search results to avoid redundant requests
- **Request Cancellation**: Aborts previous requests when new ones are made
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user feedback

### 2. Enhanced Combobox Component

- **Memoization**: All expensive operations are memoized with `useMemo` and `useCallback`
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during search operations
- **Lazy Loading**: Images use `loading="lazy"` for better performance
- **Optimized Filtering**: Efficient client-side filtering with proper memoization

### 3. API-Level Optimizations

- **Response Caching**: Server-side caching with automatic cleanup
- **Token Caching**: Spotify API tokens are cached to reduce authentication overhead
- **Error Logging**: Comprehensive error logging for debugging
- **Request Limiting**: Maximum 8 results displayed to reduce rendering overhead

### 4. Performance Monitoring

- **Metrics Collection**: Tracks search performance metrics
- **Average Time Calculation**: Monitors response times
- **Debugging Tools**: Performance utilities for development

## Technical Details

### Cache Strategy

- **Client Cache**: 5-minute TTL for search results
- **Server Cache**: 5-minute TTL for API responses
- **Token Cache**: Spotify tokens cached until 60 seconds before expiration
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Old cache entries are automatically removed

### Debouncing Implementation

- **300ms Delay**: Prevents excessive API calls during typing
- **Request Cancellation**: Previous requests are cancelled when new ones are made
- **State Management**: Proper cleanup of timeouts and abort controllers

### Memory Management

- **Limited Results**: Maximum 8 results displayed at once
- **Cache Size Limits**: Server cache limited to 100 entries
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Old cache entries and performance metrics are cleaned up

## Usage

The enhanced artist selector is automatically used in the marketing page. The performance improvements are transparent to the user but provide:

- Faster search responses
- Reduced API calls
- Better error handling
- Smoother user experience
- Visual feedback during operations

## Monitoring

Performance metrics can be accessed through the `performanceMonitor` utility:

```typescript
import { performanceMonitor } from '@/lib/utils/performance';

// Get average search time
const avgTime = performanceMonitor.getAverageTime('spotify-search');

// Get all metrics
const metrics = performanceMonitor.getMetrics();
```

## Future Improvements

- Implement virtual scrolling for large result sets
- Add keyboard navigation optimizations
- Consider implementing search suggestions
- Add analytics for search patterns
