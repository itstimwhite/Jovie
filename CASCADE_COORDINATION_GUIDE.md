## üéØ IMMEDIATE EXECUTION STRATEGY

### Phase 1: Highest Probability Targets (Start Here!)

**These PRs have the best chance of immediate success:**

1. **PR #638** - CI was actively running, may already be ready
2. **PR #643** - Recently updated with fresh CI 
3. **PR #645** - Has recent agent activity

**Quick execution:**
```bash
./scripts/fix-pr-systematic.sh 638
./scripts/fix-pr-systematic.sh 643  
./scripts/fix-pr-systematic.sh 645
```

### Phase 2: Previously Ready PRs (High Success Rate)

**These were passing before the lint config change:**

4. **PR #642** - Was ready, just lint issues from config change
5. **PR #640** - Was ready, just lint issues from config change

**Quick execution:**
```bash
./scripts/fix-pr-systematic.sh 642
./scripts/fix-pr-systematic.sh 640
```

### Phase 3: Systematic Processing

**Process remaining PRs in priority order:**

6. **PR #635** - Was unstable, now blocked
7. **PR #632** - Was unstable, now blocked  
8. **PR #630** - Was unstable, now blocked

**And continue with remaining PRs...**

## üìä COORDINATION STRATEGY

### For @codegen @copilot @claude

**AVOID DUPLICATION:** Check this guide before starting work

**CURRENT PRIORITY ORDER:**
1. PR #638 (highest probability - CI was running)
2. PR #643 (high probability - fresh CI)  
3. PR #645 (active work detected)
4. PR #642 (was ready, just lint)
5. PR #640 (was ready, just lint)

**EXECUTION PRINCIPLE:**
- **One agent per PR** to avoid conflicts
- **Start with highest probability** for quick wins
- **Report results** to coordinate next actions
- **Build momentum** with successful merges

## üîß ROOT CAUSE UNDERSTANDING

**The Issue:** Commit `41935af` introduced new lint configurations:
- `eslint.config.js` (new ESLint config)
- `biome.json` (new Biome formatter/linter)

**The Effect:** All PRs created before this commit fail the new lint rules

**The Solution:** Our automation applies the new rules automatically:
- Biome formatting and linting fixes
- ESLint fixes  
- Proper integration with new config system

---

## üéâ SUCCESS TRACKING

**Current Status: 1/18 PRs merged ‚úÖ**

**Target: 18/18 PRs merged**

**Next Milestone: 5/18 within the hour** (based on highest probability targets)

**The cascade effect is beginning - each successful merge builds momentum!**

## üí° TROUBLESHOOTING

**If a PR fails after systematic fix:**
1. Check specific CI error messages
2. May need manual code fixes (not just lint/format)
3. Could have merge conflicts requiring resolution
4. Test failures might need code changes

**If auto-merge doesn't trigger:**
1. Verify all status checks are passing
2. Confirm auto-merge is enabled: `gh pr view <number> --json autoMergeRequest`
3. Check for merge conflicts: `gh pr view <number> --json mergeable`

**The system works - PR #636 proved it. Now execute systematically!** üöÄ
