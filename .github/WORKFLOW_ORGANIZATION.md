# GitHub Workflow Organization

This document outlines the organization and purpose of all GitHub workflows in the Jovie repository.

## 🏗️ **Workflow Architecture**

### **Branch Strategy**

```
develop → preview → production
   ↓        ↓        ↓
  CI/CD    CI/CD   Production
Pipeline  Pipeline  Deployment
```

### **Workflow Flow**

1. **Develop Branch** → `develop-ci.yml` → Auto-promote to Preview
2. **Preview Branch** → `preview-ci.yml` → Manual review → Main
3. **Main Branch** → `production-deploy.yml` → Production Deployment

## 📋 **Active Workflows**

### 1. **Develop CI/CD Pipeline** (`develop-ci.yml`)

**Purpose:** Continuous integration and auto-promotion for the develop branch

**Triggers:**

- Push to `develop` branch
- Pull requests to `develop` branch
- Manual dispatch

**Jobs:**

- **CI Job:** Lint, test, build, deploy to preview environment
- **Promote Job:** Auto-create PR from develop → preview with auto-merge

**Features:**

- ✅ Type checking and linting
- ✅ Unit and integration tests
- ✅ Build verification
- ✅ Preview deployment
- ✅ Lighthouse performance testing
- ✅ Security dependency scanning
- ✅ Auto-promotion to preview branch

### 2. **Preview CI/CD Pipeline** (`preview-ci.yml`)

**Purpose:** Comprehensive testing and validation for the preview branch

**Triggers:**

- Push to `preview` branch
- Pull requests to `preview` branch
- Manual dispatch

**Jobs:**

- **CI Job:** Full testing suite with production-like environment
- **Promote Job:** Create PR from preview → production (manual review required)

**Features:**

- ✅ Full E2E testing (desktop + mobile)
- ✅ Visual regression testing
- ✅ Lighthouse performance budgets
- ✅ Bundle size analysis
- ✅ ZAP security scanning
- ✅ Dependency security audit
- ✅ Manual promotion to production

### 3. **Production Deployment** (`production-deploy.yml`)

**Purpose:** Production deployment and verification

**Triggers:**

- Push to `production` branch
- Manual dispatch

**Jobs:**

- **Deploy Job:** Production deployment with verification

**Features:**

- ✅ Production environment deployment
- ✅ Post-deployment verification
- ✅ Environment protection
- ✅ Deployment monitoring

### 4. **CodeQL Security Analysis** (`codeql.yml`)

**Purpose:** Automated security vulnerability scanning

**Triggers:**

- Push to main branches (`production`, `develop`, `preview`)
- Pull requests to main branches
- Weekly scheduled scan (Monday 13:36 UTC)

**Jobs:**

- **Analyze Job:** Security analysis for multiple languages

**Features:**

- ✅ JavaScript/TypeScript analysis
- ✅ GitHub Actions analysis
- ✅ Weekly scheduled scans
- ✅ Security vulnerability detection

### 5. **Dependabot Auto-Merge** (`dependabot-auto-merge.yml`)

**Purpose:** Automated dependency updates with safety checks

**Triggers:**

- Dependabot pull requests
- Manual dispatch

**Jobs:**

- **Auto-Merge Job:** Automated merging of safe dependency updates

**Features:**

- ✅ Automated dependency updates
- ✅ Safety checks before merging
- ✅ Conflict resolution
- ✅ Version bump automation

## 🗑️ **Removed Workflows**

The following workflows were removed during cleanup as they were unused or redundant:

### ❌ **Removed Workflows:**

1. `web-confidence-loop.yml` - **UNUSED** (Preview Confidence Loop)
2. `web-lighthouse-ci.yml` - **REDUNDANT** (Lighthouse CI)
3. `web-pr-verify.yml` - **MISSING** (File didn't exist)
4. `web-rapid-loop.yml` - **REDUNDANT** (Dev Rapid Loop)
5. `web-release-loop.yml` - **REDUNDANT** (Release Loop)
6. `codeql-analysis.yml` - **REDUNDANT** (Duplicate CodeQL)
7. `promote-preview.yml` - **REDUNDANT** (Manual promotion)

### **Removal Reasons:**

- **Unused:** Workflows that weren't being triggered
- **Redundant:** Duplicate functionality already covered by other workflows
- **Missing:** Files that didn't actually exist
- **Outdated:** Workflows using old patterns or configurations

## 🔄 **Workflow Dependencies**

### **Develop → Preview Promotion**

```
develop-ci.yml
├── CI checks pass
├── Preview deployment
└── Auto-create PR (develop → preview)
    └── Auto-merge enabled
```

### **Preview → Main Promotion**

```
preview-ci.yml
├── Full E2E tests
├── Security scans
├── Performance budgets
└── Manual PR (preview → production)
    └── Manual review required
```

### **Main → Production Deployment**

```
production-deploy.yml
├── Production deployment
├── Environment verification
└── Post-deployment checks
```

## 🛡️ **Security & Compliance**

### **Security Workflows:**

- **CodeQL:** Weekly security vulnerability scanning
- **Dependabot:** Automated dependency updates with security checks
- **ZAP Scanning:** DAST security testing in preview environment
- **Dependency Audit:** High+ severity vulnerability detection

### **Compliance Features:**

- ✅ Automated security scanning
- ✅ Dependency vulnerability management
- ✅ Performance monitoring
- ✅ Accessibility testing
- ✅ Visual regression testing

## 📊 **Monitoring & Metrics**

### **Performance Metrics:**

- Lighthouse performance scores
