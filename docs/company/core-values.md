# 🌟 Jovie Core Values

### 1. Ship Small, Ship Fast

- **Why**: Short cycles → fast compounding improvements.
- **AI Interpretation**: Prioritize merging small PRs with clear tests. Avoid bloated diffs.
- **Result**: Tighter feedback loops, more iterations, faster learning.

### 2. Clarity Over Cleverness

- **Why**: The simplest solution that works is best.
- **AI Interpretation**: Generate code that’s readable, minimal, and obvious. Avoid “magic.”
- **Result**: Code stays maintainable as AI contributes more.

### 3. Build for the User, Not for Us

- **Why**: What matters is if users love it, not if we’re proud of the code.
- **AI Interpretation**: When writing features/tests/docs, bias toward UX, usability, and user outcome.
- **Result**: Product love > engineering ego.

### 4. Default to Automation

- **Why**: Repetition is beneath us; systemize and abstract.
- **AI Interpretation**: Identify patterns and propose scripts, tests, or infra to automate them.
- **Result**: Free brainpower for innovation, not toil.

### 5. Fast Feedback > Perfect Coverage

- **Why**: Speed matters more than exhaustive safety.
- **AI Interpretation**: Keep unit tests under 200ms, mock external services, push heavier validation into integration tests.
- **Result**: AI can run full CI/CD confidently and fast.

### 6. Polish Is the Product

- **Why**: Sexy design and copy = trust + conversion.
- **AI Interpretation**: Never settle for default states; add animations, error handling, magical copy.
- **Result**: AI doesn’t just generate working code; it generates delightful UX.

### 7. Best Idea Wins

- **Why**: Ego kills progress; truth emerges from testing.
- **AI Interpretation**: Explore multiple implementations, compare tradeoffs, pick what aligns with metrics.
- **Result**: The right solution surfaces, even if AI or junior dev suggests it.

### 8. Bias for Measurable Outcomes

- **Why**: Gut is good, but metrics drive growth.
- **AI Interpretation**: Attach KPIs and PostHog events to features by default.
- **Result**: Every release becomes a data point, not a guess.

### 9. Progressive Security

- **Why**: Secure by default, without slowing iteration.
- **AI Interpretation**: Apply Clerk/Stripe/Drizzle guardrails automatically; enforce RLS, mock secrets in tests.
- **Result**: Safer product without blocking shipping velocity.

### 10. Wake Up Like a Puppy

- **Why**: Every day is fresh; excitement compounds.
- **AI Interpretation**: Treat each run as a clean slate; reset assumptions, re-validate, and improve.
- **Result**: Energy and curiosity flow into every cycle.
