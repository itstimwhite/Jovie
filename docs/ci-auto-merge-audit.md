# CI Auto-Merge Audit & Consolidation

## Summary

Consolidated 3 separate auto-merge workflows into one intelligent workflow that handles all PR types while maintaining safety and efficiency.

## Previous Issues

### 🚨 **Root Causes of Manual PR Management**

1. **Multiple Competing Workflows**: 3 separate auto-merge workflows that interfered with each other
2. **Strict Up-to-Date Requirements**: Branch rulesets require `strict_required_status_checks_policy: true`
3. **No Merge Queue**: GitHub merge queue not available/configured - this would solve ordering automatically
4. **Branch Update Race Conditions**: PRs go "BEHIND" when multiple PRs merge simultaneously

### **Old Workflows (Removed)**

- `dependabot-auto-merge.yml` - Only handled Dependabot PRs
- `codegen-auto-merge.yml` - Only handled codegen PRs
- `auto-merge-preview.yml` - Generic workflow for all PRs

**Problems with old approach:**

- Workflows competed to enable auto-merge
- No coordination between different PR types
- Manual branch updates required when PRs went stale
- Inconsistent behavior across PR types

## New Consolidated Approach

### ✅ **Single Smart Workflow (`auto-merge.yml`)**

**Features:**

- **Unified Logic**: Handles Dependabot, codegen, and regular PRs in one place
- **Intelligent Branch Updating**: Automatically updates stale branches before enabling auto-merge
- **Safety First**: Validates update types for Dependabot (patch/minor + security only)
- **Label-Based Control**: Respects blocking labels (`blocked`, `human-review`, `no-auto-merge`)
- **CI Integration**: Waits for all required status checks from branch rulesets
- **Conflict Prevention**: Uses concurrency groups to prevent workflow conflicts

**PR Type Handling:**

```yaml
Dependabot PRs: ✅ Patch/minor version updates (e.g., 1.2.3 → 1.2.4)
  ✅ Security updates (any version jump)
  ❌ Major version updates (require human review)

Codegen PRs: ✅ Auto-merge if labeled with 'codegen'
  ❌ Skip if labeled with 'needs-human', 'blocked', etc.

Regular PRs: ✅ Auto-merge if labeled with 'auto-merge' or 'dependencies'
  ❌ Manual review required by default
```

### 🔧 **Modified Up-to-Date Check**

Updated `ci.yml` to be smarter about branch updates:

- **Auto-merge PRs**: Allows behind branches (workflow handles updating)
- **Manual PRs**: Still requires up-to-date branches
- **Clear messaging**: Explains what's happening and next steps

## Branch Ruleset Analysis

**Current Configuration (Preview Branch):**

```json
{
  "strict_required_status_checks_policy": true,
  "required_status_checks": [
    "PR Policy",
    "Lint",
    "Typecheck",
    "Build",
    "Unit Tests",
    "E2E Tests"
  ],
  "allowed_merge_methods": ["merge", "squash", "rebase"]
}
```

**Status:** ✅ Well configured, but **no merge queue available**

## Recommendations

### 🎯 **Immediate Benefits (Already Implemented)**

1. **Reduced Manual Work**: Auto-merge workflow handles branch updates automatically
2. **Consistent Behavior**: Single workflow for all PR types
3. **Better Error Handling**: Clear messaging and retry logic
4. **Safety Maintained**: Dependency update validation and required status checks

### 🚀 **Future Improvements**

1. **Enable GitHub Merge Queue** (when available):

   ```bash
   # Would eliminate need for branch updating entirely
   gh api repos/itstimwhite/Jovie/rulesets/7152953 \
     --method PATCH \
     --field rules[5].type=merge_queue \
     --field rules[5].parameters.merge_method=squash
   ```

2. **Add Auto-merge Labels Automatically**:
   - Dependabot PRs: Auto-labeled
   - Codegen PRs: Auto-labeled
   - Regular dependency PRs: Could auto-label based on file patterns

3. **Enhanced Monitoring**:
   - Add workflow success/failure notifications
   - Track auto-merge rates and failure reasons

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] **Dependabot PR**: Patch update should auto-merge
- [ ] **Dependabot PR**: Major update should require manual review
- [ ] **Codegen PR**: Should auto-merge with proper labels
- [ ] **Regular PR**: Should require manual review unless labeled
- [ ] **Behind Branch**: Should auto-update then merge
- [ ] **Blocked Labels**: Should skip auto-merge entirely
- [ ] **CI Failures**: Should not enable auto-merge

## Monitoring

Watch for these metrics to validate success:

1. **Manual PR updates required** (should decrease significantly)
2. **Auto-merge success rate** (should be >90% for eligible PRs)
3. **Time to merge** (should decrease for dependency updates)
4. **CI failure rate** (should remain the same - no safety compromise)

## Emergency Rollback

If the new workflow causes issues:

```bash
# Disable auto-merge workflow
gh workflow disable auto-merge.yml

# Re-enable old workflows (if needed)
git revert <commit-hash>
```

The workflow is designed to be safe-first - it will skip rather than cause damage if uncertain.
